### We have provided a simple demonstration of F-FMPA (free to migrate it to other FL scenarios). It aims to launch precise model poisoning attacks (MPAs) in federated learning. 

#### Test:

- run **FMPA.py ** for attacking federated learning.


#### Dependencies:

python==3.6.13

pytorch==1.10.2

torchvision==0.9.0

numpy==1.19.5

pandas==1.1.5

pickleshare==0.7.4
